This code was orginally written in 2007 in my high school computer engineering course. I was required to create a Halloween themed animation script. 

To run the script you require the Turing IDE. I have zipped v4.1.1 and added it to the repo. Simply unzip, run turing.exe, click open, and open the monste7.t file. Then click run. 

Additional comments: 
- I am unsure why it is called monste7. Perhaps it was the 7th version and the 'r' from monster was lost along the way. 
- The "bug" with the ghost was accidental but kept to make it look more ghostly. I may attempt to fix it at some point in the future. 
- The monster design was based off of an old book I had as a kid that briefly went over greek mythology.
